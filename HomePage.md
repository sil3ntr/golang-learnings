## HomePage

* On wide screen, there is a large gap for question section
* Solutions sub menu goes to products top level page rather than solutions top level page
* Main Menu - Should not include the page group name in the URL

## News
 * Add mockup placeholder images
 * News details pages dont work they are refrencing localhost and seem to be hardcoded 
 * While there is not enough items for the pagination to be display I assume that does work when we have over 6 news items ? pls confirm

 ## Search
 * Based on a quick test it only seems to provide results if it matches to a news item ?
 * Style Pagination to the same style as news pagination with Red 
 
## General Display
* Content seems narrow in sections even at a defacto 1920 - 1080p resolution
* Sounds Interesting section
    * Persons Name and title and the image don't align

## Mobile Display
 * Red box with email and slider control - needs some text perhaps just "Questions ?"
 * Big Gaps of between sections
 * Sound Interesting section formatting looks a bit off
 * Footer on mobile is all left hand aligned, looks a bit odd
